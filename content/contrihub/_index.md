# ContriHub - Open Source Celebration

**ContriHub** is our annual month-long celebration of open source contributions. Every October-November, we organize a beginner-friendly event where students make their first (or continued) contributions to open source projects.

> Unlike competitive coding events, ContriHub focuses on **learning, collaboration, and community building** - not rankings or leaderboards.

## What is ContriHub?

ContriHub is more than just a contribution event - it's a supportive environment where:

- **🌱 Beginners feel welcome** - No prior experience required
- **🤝 Community helps each other** - Seniors mentor juniors
- **🎯 All contributions count equally** - Features, bugs, docs, tests all matter
- **🌟 Learning is celebrated** - Growth over numbers
- **💡 Diverse skills are valued** - Not just coding!

### Philosophy

**What We DO**:
- ✅ Celebrate collective achievements
- ✅ Recognize diverse contribution types equally
- ✅ Highlight learning and growth
- ✅ Show impact of contributions
- ✅ Encourage beginners

**What We DON'T DO**:
- ❌ Leaderboards or rankings
- ❌ "Top N contributors" lists  
- ❌ Public PR counts
- ❌ Competitive scoring
- ❌ Making anyone feel inadequate

## How It Works

### 1. Event Period (October 15 - November 15)

A month-long window to make contributions at your own pace. No pressure, no rush.

### 2. Choose Your Repositories

We curate a list of **club repositories** and **beginner-friendly open source projects**:
- CC Club Website
- DSA Practice Platform
- Alumni Portal
- Community-maintained tools
- Selected external projects with good documentation

### 3. Pick Your Contribution Type

**All of these count equally**:
- 🐛 **Bug Fixes** - Fix issues and improve stability
- ✨ **New Features** - Add functionality
- 📚 **Documentation** - Improve docs, add examples
- 🧪 **Testing** - Write tests, improve coverage
- 🎨 **Design** - UI improvements, accessibility
- 🔧 **Refactoring** - Code quality improvements
- 📝 **Content** - Blog posts, tutorials

### 4. Get Support

- **Kickoff Workshop** - Git, GitHub, PR workflow
- **Weekly Office Hours** - Get help with blockers
- **Discord Support** - Active community assistance
- **Mentor Pairing** - One-on-one guidance for beginners

### 5. Submit Pull Requests

Make meaningful contributions, get reviews, iterate, and merge!

### 6. Recognition Ceremony

At the end, we celebrate everyone's contributions:
- Community recognitions (not rankings!)
- Contributor spotlights
- Impact showcase
- Certificates for all participants
