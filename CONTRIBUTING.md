## How to Add Content

### Adding a Blog Post

Blog posts are stored in `content/blog/YEAR/`.

**Steps:**

1. **Create a new file** in the appropriate year folder:
   ```
   content/blog/2025/your-post-title.md
   ```

2. **Use this template** for your blog post:

```markdown
+++
title = "Your Awesome Post Title"
date = 2025-01-15
description = "A brief summary of your post (1-2 sentences)"

[extra]
author = "Your Name"
author_github = "yourgithub"
reading_time = 8
tags = ["tutorial", "web-development"]
categories = ["Technical"]
+++

# Introduction

Your content starts here...

## Section 1

More content...

## Conclusion

Wrap up your post...
```

3. **Add images** (if needed):
   - Place images in `static/images/blog/2025/`
   - Reference in markdown: `![Alt text](images/blog/2025/your-image.jpg)`

4. **Preview your post**:
   - If you have Zola installed: `zola serve`
   - Otherwise, just ensure the markdown looks good in your editor

5. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add content/blog/2025/your-post-title.md
   git commit -m "Add blog post: Your Post Title"
   git push origin main
   ```

**Tips:**
- Keep titles clear and descriptive
- Use tags consistently (check existing posts for common tags)
- Include code examples where relevant
- Proofread before committing!

**Steps:**

1. **Open the file**: `data/team.yaml`

2. **Add a new member** to the appropriate section (faculty, coordinators, or executives):

```yaml
executives:
  - name: "Your Name"
    role: "Executive Member"
    year: "2nd Year"
    branch: "CSE"
    image: "images/team/your-photo.jpg"

### Creating a Roadmap

Roadmaps are in `content/roadmaps/`.

**Steps:**

1. **Create a new file**:
   ```
   content/roadmaps/your-domain.md
   ```

2. **Use this structure**:

```markdown
+++
title = "Your Domain Roadmap"
description = "Structured learning path for Domain"
date = 2025-01-15

[extra]
tags = ["roadmap", "learning-path"]
categories = ["Roadmaps"]
+++

# Introduction

Brief overview of the domain...

## Prerequisites

What you should know before starting...

## The Roadmap

### Level 1: Foundation (2-3 months)

**What you'll learn:**
- Topic 1
- Topic 2

**Resources:**
- [Resource 1](URL)
- [Resource 2](URL)

**Practice Projects:**
- Project idea 1
- Project idea 2

---

### Level 2: Intermediate (3-4 months)

[Same structure as Level 1]

[Continue with more levels...]
```

3. **Optional: Add a visual diagram** using Mermaid:

````markdown
{% mermaid() %}
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Learn Basics]
    B --> C[Build Projects]
    C --> D[Advanced Topics]
{% end %}
````

**Roadmap Guidelines:**
- Break into logical levels/phases
- Provide time estimates
- Include both learning resources and practice projects
- Keep it practical and actionable
- Update based on feedback

---

## Important Notes

### Taxonomies (Tags & Categories)

**For Blog Posts, Events, and Roadmaps:**
- Taxonomies (tags and categories) should be placed in the `[extra]` section, NOT in a separate `[taxonomies]` section
- This is due to how Zola handles taxonomies with our configuration

**Example:**
```markdown
+++
title = "My Blog Post"
date = 2025-01-15

[extra]
tags = ["tutorial", "web-development"]
categories = ["Technical"]
+++
```

### Standalone Pages (About, Team, Alumni, etc.)

**For pages that are NOT blog posts, events, or sorted content:**
- Add a `weight` field to determine page ordering
- These pages don't need a `date` field
- Lower weight numbers appear first

**Example:**
```markdown
+++
title = "About Us"
description = "About our club"
weight = 1
+++
```

### Using Mermaid Diagrams

**Correct syntax:**
````markdown
{% mermaid() %}
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Next Step]
{% end %}
````

**Don't use** (this will cause warnings):
````markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Next Step]
```
````

---

## Markdown Syntax Guide

### Basic Formatting

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**Bold text**
*Italic text*
~~Strikethrough~~

[Link text](https://example.com)
![Image alt text](images/path/to/image.jpg)
```

### Lists

```markdown
Unordered list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item

Ordered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third
```

### Code

Inline code: \`code here\`

Code blocks:
````markdown
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
````

### Quotes

```markdown
> This is a blockquote
> It can span multiple lines
```

### Tables

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
```

### Advanced Features

**Alerts** (using shortcodes):
```markdown
{{ alert_info(text="This is an information alert") }}
{{ alert_warning(text="This is a warning") }}
{{ alert_success(text="Success message") }}
{{ alert_error(text="Error message") }}
```

**Badges**:
```markdown
{{ badge_primary(text="Important") }}
{{ badge_success(text="New") }}
```

**Math** (using KaTeX):
```markdown

## Working with Git

### Basic Git Workflow

1. **Check status**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Stage changes**:
   ```bash
   git add filename.md           # Add specific file
   git add .                     # Add all changes
   ```

3. **Commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Descriptive message about changes"
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Commit Message Guidelines

Good commit messages:
- ✅ "Add blog post about React Hooks"
- ✅ "Update team members for 2025"
- ✅ "Fix broken link in resources page"

Bad commit messages:
- ❌ "Update"
- ❌ "Changes"
- ❌ "asdfasdf"

**Format:**
```
Type: Brief description

Optional longer explanation if needed
```

**Types:**
- `Add:` New content/features
- `Update:` Modify existing content
- `Fix:` Bug fixes or corrections
- `Remove:` Delete content
- `Docs:` Documentation changes

### Syncing with Upstream

If the main repository has updates:

```bash
# Add upstream remote (one-time setup)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ccc-lnmiit/cc-website.git

# Fetch and merge updates
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

### Troubleshooting Git

**Undo last commit** (but keep changes):
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

**Discard all local changes**:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
```

**See commit history**:
```bash
git log --oneline
```

- **Git Basics**: [https://git-scm.com/doc](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- **GitHub Guides**: [https://guides.github.com/](https://guides.github.com/)

### Getting Support

**Stuck? Have questions?**

1. **Check existing documentation** (README, this guide)
2. **Search closed issues** on GitHub
3. **Ask on Discord** (fastest response)
4. **Open a GitHub issue** for technical problems
5. **Contact maintainers** directly

**When asking for help, include:**
- What you're trying to do
- What you've tried
- Error messages (if any)
- Screenshots (if relevant)

### Common Issues

**Problem:** "I don't have Zola installed, can I still contribute?"
**Solution:** Yes! For content changes (blog posts, events, etc.), you don't need Zola. Just edit the markdown files and create a PR.

**Problem:** "My YAML file has errors"
**Solution:** YAML is whitespace-sensitive. Use 2 spaces for indentation (not tabs). Use a YAML validator: [https://www.yamllint.com/](https://www.yamllint.com/)

**Problem:** "Images aren't showing"
**Solution:** 
- Check file path is correct
- Ensure image is in `static/` directory
- Use forward slashes (`/`) in paths
- Reference from site root: `images/blog/2025/image.jpg`

**Problem:** "Git push rejected"
**Solution:** Pull latest changes first:
```bash
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```
